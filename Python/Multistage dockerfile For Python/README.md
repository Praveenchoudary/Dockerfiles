Multi-Stage Dockerfile

A multi-stage Dockerfile allows you to build Docker images in multiple stages, which helps in reducing the size of the final image and improving security. This approach separates the build environment from the runtime environment, ensuring that only the necessary artifacts are included in the final image.

Benefits of Multi-Stage Builds

* Smaller Image Size: By copying only the necessary files from the build stage to the final image, you can significantly reduce the size of your Docker images.

* Improved Security: The final image contains only the runtime dependencies, reducing the attack surface and minimizing vulnerabilities.

* Better Organization: Multi-stage builds help you organize your Dockerfile, making it easier to understand and maintain.

* Simplified Builds: You can include build tools and dependencies in the build stage without cluttering the final image.
