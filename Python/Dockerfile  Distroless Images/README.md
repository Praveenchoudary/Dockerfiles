Distroless images are minimal Docker images that contain only the application and its runtime dependencies, but no shell or package manager. They are a popular choice for production because they provide a much smaller attack surface and reduced image size, leading to better security and performance.
Google maintains a set of distroless base images for various programming languages, including Go, Python, Node.js, and others. These images strip away unnecessary operating system components like package managers and shells, leaving just the necessary files to run your application.
Why Use Distroless Images?
•	Smaller image sizes: Only necessary runtime dependencies are included.
•	Improved security: Reduces the attack surface by excluding unnecessary packages.
•	Fewer vulnerabilities: Since no extra software is included, fewer security vulnerabilities are present in the image.

Distroless images are minimal Docker images that include only the application and its runtime dependencies, without any additional operating system components like shells or package managers. They aim to enhance security and reduce the image size, making them an excellent choice for production environments.

Key Characteristics of Distroless Images
Minimal Size: Distroless images are typically smaller than standard images because they do not include a full operating system or unnecessary components.
Enhanced Security: By omitting shells and package managers, the attack surface is significantly reduced, which enhances the overall security of the application.
Fewer Vulnerabilities: The limited number of components means there are fewer potential vulnerabilities, making it easier to keep the image secure.
Common Distroless Images
Google provides several distroless images for different languages, including:

Java: gcr.io/distroless/java
Python: gcr.io/distroless/python
Node.js: gcr.io/distroless/nodejs
Go: gcr.io/distroless/base (for statically compiled binaries)
.NET: gcr.io/distroless/dotnet

Using distroless images can lead to more secure, efficient, and maintainable Docker containers. By leveraging multi-stage builds, you can ensure that your production images are minimal, containing only what is necessary to run your application. This approach is particularly beneficial for microservices and cloud-native applications.
